# FlightSurety_Complete

FlightSurety is a sample application for Udacity's Blockchain nanodegree. It is an overall project, that is separated within two applications: the FlightCompanies application and the FlightDelay Insurance Dapp.
The former is a centralized fullstack Javascript web application that gives the opportunity to users login and book a flight.
The frontend part of the application has been developped using the Angular framework and the backend part using NodeJs and Postgres.
The latter is a decentralized application that allows users to purchase insurance for their flights.
The smart contract will automatically pay out if the flight is delayed, providing a transparent and secure way for users to protect themselves from flight delays.
This README file will guide you through the project requirements, installation instructions, and usage of the Flight Delay Insurance Dapp.
The project is in progress and further documentations should be provided along the development stages.
